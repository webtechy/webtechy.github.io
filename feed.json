The lack of flexibility, functionality and customization you get from these platforms versus running these services in your own private cloud or a relatively lower cost cloud or VPS service is difficult to beat if you're looking for getting your online business to the next level without paying (Wix, Squarespace and Webflow up to thousands of dollars per year) and having to learn how to manage your online site through their complex platforms. These website builder platforms also do not offer any additional document/photo management which would then add additional costs for separate online services where you still do not own your own data. </p>\n<p>Â </p>",
