<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"><strong>Domain &amp; DNS</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> is both the domain registrar as well as the DNS/CDN as I tried other domain registrars from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="http://tld-list.com">tld-list.com</a> but found that it's just easier to manage with the features for managing DNS, CNAMEs, A records, MX Email routing and aliases all in one place.</p>
<p><strong>Proxy layer (Oracle Cloud Free Tier)</strong></p>
<p>I wanted a proxy layer that could run <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://nginxproxymanager.com/">Nginx Proxy Manager</a> (find it easier than using Caddy or Traefik but may revisit) to manage all the various subdomains I wanted to point my container apps to and finally realized that I was already using Tailscale which could connect my self-hosted homelab servers while bypassing CGNAT. See <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/last-reverse-proxy-you-need">https://tailscale.com/blog/last-reverse-proxy-you-need</a></p>
<p><strong>Jamstack (portfolio &amp; blog site)</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to separate my portfolio and blog site rather than hosting my own docker app for Ghost/Wordpress since using Netlify/Vercel with Github/Cloudflare Pages for a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://jamstack.org/">Jamstack</a> has improved greatly since almost a decade ago when I first started with static-site generators like Jekyll, Hugo and other similar SSGs as now Next.js w/ React is the most popular and capable where you can do a lot more I found with new entries like Wisp+Vercel which is what I'm using now.</p>
<p><strong>App layer (self-hosted docker apps)</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Cosmos Cloud (Docker management platform)</p>

<p>Nextcloud (Open Source Google Drive alternative)</p>

<p>Immich (Open Source Google Photos alternative)</p>

<p>There are a lot of options for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://medium.com/swlh/i-tried-30-free-ai-website-builders-these-7-are-the-absolute-best-a01f2e3a62fc">no code or low code website builders</a> to choose from and you can also just pay someone to build a website but even if you don't account for the relatively low costs of web hosting these days. The lack of flexibility, functionality and customization you get from these platforms versus running these services in your own private cloud or a relatively lower cost cloud or VPS service is difficult to beat if you're looking for getting your online business to the next level without paying (Wix, Squarespace and Webflow up to thousands of dollars per year) and having to learn how to manage your online site through their complex platforms. These website builder platforms also do not offer any additional document/photo management which would then add additional costs for separate online services where you still do not own your own data. </p>
